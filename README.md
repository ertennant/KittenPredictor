# Kitten Predictor 

## Description 

This app provides a prediction of the physical traits kittens could inherit given the traits of the parent cats. 

## How to Use 

This app is currently available through GitHub Pages. Open [https://ertennant.github.io/KittenPredictor/](https://ertennant.github.io/KittenPredictor/) to use the app in your browser. 

In standard mode, simply enter one or more traits (e.g., `orange`, `longhair`, `colorpoint`) for each parent and click `Generate Kittens` to see the results. Click again for new results - due to the randomness involved in genetic inheritance, they might be different! 

In advanced mode, you control the parent cats' appearance by setting their genes directly. Tap or hover over the question mark icons to view explanations for how each gene affects the cat's appearance. Note that some traits override others - for example, if a cat has the genes for both white and orange, it will be white (but the kittens could be orange, depending on what they inherit).
