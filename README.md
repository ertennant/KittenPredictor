# Kitten Predictor 

## Description 

This simple app allows the user to input the physical traits of two cats, and then uses that information to generate a prediction of what the resulting kittens could inherit. 

More features coming soon!


## How to Use 

This app is currently available through GitHub Pages. Open [https://ertennant.github.io/KittenPredictor/](https://ertennant.github.io/KittenPredictor/) to use the app in your browser. Enter names for the parent cats in the input boxes labelled `Mother` and `Father`. Start typing traits (e.g., `orange`, `longhair`, or `Persian`) in the `Enter Trait` input box and click the desired trait in the dropdown menu. Use the `Number of Kittens` input to control how many kittens to generate. When you are ready to see the results, click `Generate Kittens`. Click again to generate a new litter of kittens - results are generated according to probability, so each litter of kittens may have different traits!
